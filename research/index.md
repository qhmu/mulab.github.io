## Drug resistance
Drug resistance is a major obstacle undermining the efficacy of cancer therapy. It is now recognized that drug resistance is a multi-faceted problem where genomics, epigenetics, and tumor microenvironment are all playing a role. We will therefore develop innovative computational methods, from basic statistical tests to machine learning and artificial intelligence, to analyze multi-omics data to identify biomarkers and drug targets useful for disease treatment.
